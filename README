My proof! 

These are the scripts I could find. Theres a few more but I misplaced them. This was all done way before I even knew what github was.
This is how I learned to program, how to use variables and how to do math at higher levels.

With that it should be know that this code is not the greatest. I also believe you should try the problem first instead of using mine. 
The big thing about Project Euler is figuring it out yourself. 

With more free time I will be trying more of these questions. I want to get atleast one 100 level question or higher!
